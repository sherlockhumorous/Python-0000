I like watching horror movie. My friends admire me for this reason. But before, I was very afraid of horrible things, like ghost story, even in the dark would scare me. I remembered that as a-three-year old girl, I beg my mother to tell me the story before I went to bed. Some day, she told me a story about a girl disappeared in the dark. Then in the dream, I could think of the darkness that wanted to cover me. For some time, when I went upstairs at night, I felt so scared. I would rush to my room and then went to sleep soon. As I grew up, I conquered my fear by watching horror movies. I knew the ghost did not exist, and the real fear was from our heart.
